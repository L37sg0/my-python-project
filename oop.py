# # Blueprint for a User is called a class
# # Specific implementation of the User is called an object

# Classes
# - class is like an object constructor
# - all classes have a __init__() function
# - __init__() is executed automatically, whenever
# we create the object from this class

# "self" Parameter
# - self is a reference to the current instance of the class
# - is used to access variables that belong to the class
